# Game-of-life 

Simulation of environment with herbivores, carnivores and plants were the animals can
move, give birth and eat each other. After the user enters the size of the grid(environment)
the animals and plants are randomly generated, and the actions of the entities happen on
the start of turns that represented the time passing. 
(From this project we learned object oriented code and hierarchy on classes)
